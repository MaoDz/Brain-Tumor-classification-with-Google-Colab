Classification of brain tumours from MRI using Deep Learning.

## Informations
The objective of this project is to understand the functioning of existing brain tumour classification tools for research purposes and to compare three of these approaches. 
That is, to compare classifiers in the classification of existing tumour types. This will involve the use of a CNN with data augmentation (Sadoon and Ali, 2021). 
In addition, we will also see the use of an existing model (Szegedy et al., 2015) and the use of a transfer learning model combined with an SVM (Rehman et al., 2020).
